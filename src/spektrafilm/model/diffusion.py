# Per-family strength-independent PSF shape, as three groups
# {core, halo, bloom} each expanded into a small geometric progression of
# 2D isotropic exponentials. The full PSF is
#
#     K_s(r) = w_c * K_core(r) + w_h * K_halo(r) + w_b * K_bloom(r)
#
# with w_c + w_h + w_b = 1 and each group itself a sum of N exponentials
#
#     K_x(r) = sum_k w_x[k] * E(r; lambda_x[k]),
#     E(r; lambda) = exp(-r / lambda) / (2 * pi * lambda**2),
#
# normalised so sum_k w_x[k] = 1 inside each group. Sub-component
# wavelengths span a geometric progression in [lambda_um / spread,
# lambda_um * spread]. For core and halo the within-group weights are
# uniform — every exponential in the progression contributes equally,
# which gives a smooth log-normal-ish blur with no internal knees. For
# the bloom the within-group weights follow a power-law schedule
# w_k ∝ lambda_k**(2 - alpha): a continuous integral of this schedule
# over lambda gives a 2D radial profile decaying as r**(-alpha) at
# large r, so the discretised bloom approximates a power-law with
# tail exponent alpha — replacing the explicit Student-t we had before
# while keeping everything in one basis family (no glued seams between
# exponential and power-law components).
#
# Why this is smoother than the previous core+halo+bloom-each-a-single-
# exponential model: adjacent groups' lambda ranges overlap, so the
# transition between e.g. halo and bloom happens through a partially
# overlapping band of scales rather than at one hard handoff radius.
# Energy distributes across scales continuously and the radial profile
# loses its visible knees.
#
# Per-family values are distilled from the private diffusion-filter

#
#     resolution preservation  : glimmerglass > BPM > pro_mist > cinebloom
#     halo prominence/radius   : cinebloom >= pro_mist >= BPM > glimmerglass
#     veil / shadow lift       : cinebloom > pro_mist >= BPM > glimmerglass
#     absorption (deep blacks) : BPM only (black-particle design)
#     halo color (warmth axis) : cinebloom > BPM > pro_mist > glimmerglass
#
# Halo color: each family carries a `halo_warmth_base` that drives a
# physically-motivated, energy-conserving redistribution of weights
# inside the halo group. Warmth > 0 pushes warm light (R + slight G)
# toward the OUTER halo sub-components and cool light (B) toward the
# inner ones (and vice versa for warmth < 0) — the warm-rim / cool-core
# look that reference images of mist and bloom filters consistently
# show around practical light sources. The per-channel weights are
# clipped and renormalized so total halo energy per channel is
# preserved exactly even when the modulation is strong. The user knob
# `DiffusionFilterParams.halo_warmth` adds on top of the per-family
